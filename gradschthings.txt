UMem - Math Masters - In-state resident. - May 15 deadline. This one you can just  

Berkeley - CS Phd - Probably the biggest reach here. I'm really interested in the degree path for Scientific Computing (https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Areas/SCI/), especially the mathematical Topic Areas like Matrix Computation and Floating Point. I am also very curious about the mathematical underpinnings of Parallel Computing and Animation. 

UIUC

GWU - I want to go into the specific research areas (prioritized by GWU's math dept) of "Graph Theory and Combinatorics" and "Applied Mathematics". I've worked heavily on both of these over the course of my theses, and I'm very interested in the overlap between them.

UChicago - This is a big reach, I would be surprised if I got in. I want to apply to their phd program for Computational and Applied Mathematics. I am very interested in all of the classes listed in the outline here (https://cam.uchicago.edu/academics/graduate-programs/phd-program/) - January 9, 2024
