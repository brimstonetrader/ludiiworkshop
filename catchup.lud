				TURN - Initially, Black drops one stone, then for the remaining turns players drop one or two stones of either color. If one makes a group larger than the previously largest group on their turn, their opponent may place up to three stones.
				GOAL - After the board is full, the player with the largest group wins. If there's a tie, the next largest group is scored, and so on. Draws are impossible")
