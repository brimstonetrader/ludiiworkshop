
    Here are the broad categories of card game (an "X" means an example has been created in CardStock):

    

    X    ADDING       	(like cribbage)

      	 DECK-BUILDING	(like magic, likely out of our scope this summer)

    X    TRICK-TAKING 	(like spades. the primordial category, equivalent to abstracts like amazons hackenbush or clobber)

    X    COLLECTING   	(like war or ers)

    X    COMPARING    	(like poker)

    X    DRAW-DISCARD 	(like rummy)

   	 MATCHING     	(like my personal favorite, dominos. a domino ludeme exists

   	   		   	and has been implemented for the     

   					   "boneyard" ruleset, but not Jamaican style which is my preference.* Implementing this, and perhaps

   					   generalizing this Ludeme, is one of the first things I plan to do.)

   	 RACING       	(rare. best eg i could find "milles borne")

    X    SHEDDING     	(like uno)

   	 SOCIAL DEDUCTION (like mafia)





  sixlove
  score
  
I tried to begin on six love last week, but got intimidated very quick and decided I needed to work my way up to it. Regardless, this will be a game I implement involving multi-player hidden information.

X teeko
I catchup
X hexade
I ayu
I ordo
  gekitai
  aries
  gounki

These are abstract strategy games that will take effort to implement that I have been using to learn the ropes.

  oswald
  entropy

These games are also abstract strategy, but involve hierarchical scoring like poker. I believe that getting this mechanic down will be important to implementing such games. Entropy could also get me using the RNGs creatively.

  minesweeper
  nonogram
  sudoku
  galaxies

These games are what I would declare n-ary selection puzzles. Despite them being touted in most Ludii ephemera, they're pretty lacking. I think implementing decent algorithms that generate random puzzles (for like one of these I'm not spending more than 2 days on this) would be cool esp. since I did something similar in "Combinatorics of Square Grid Regions"




tetris

This game involves being dealt a random one of seven cards. I think if 2048 can exist here I could make tetris without it taking too long. I think this is probably beyond my scope here but I'd also be very down to go at it.

*boneyard sucks man there's no strategy to it feels like uno. Great if you're playing with a small child but 
not like an adults hanging out card game. Jamaican-style involves much more calculation to play well in my experience,
and (this is crucial) is enjoyable to play poorly, though moreso to play thoughtfully. everyone i've met with nostalgia 
for boneyard or even score (which people get fired up on behalf of in the South especially) has conceded that 
jamaican-style is way more conducive to social recreation. it gets people more emotionally invested, too! Purely from 
a math standpoint, it's wildly natural, as 28=7*2*2. O
